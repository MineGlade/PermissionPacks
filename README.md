# Permission Packs
#### Permission Packs is an open-source Spigot project that does exactly what the title describes.
By installing this plugin you get access to dozens of (very useful) permission preset packs. 
all the permissions and presets can be found inside the [plugin.yml](https://github.com/MineGlade/PermissionPacks/blob/master/src/main/resources/plugin.yml), or below.
This plugin.yml is commented so that it is easier to browse.

If you are missing any permission packs, you can either request them by opening an issue, 
or fork the repo, make your edits and make a pull request.
